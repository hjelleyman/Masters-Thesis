\section{Literature Review}
In this literature review, we aim to tell you a story of research which has been done in this area of research before this point in time. In doing this we hope to provide the reader of this thesis an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of relevant literature. What has and what hasn't been done by other researchers. We also will take some time to delve into the papers most relevant to this project by discussing methods and results which we at least considered using in the process of doing our research.\medskip

This literature review will be structured to look at specific topics which are somehow related to the research we carried out. These topics are included in the left hand column of the table below, alongside with the counts for the numbers of papers we looked at for each topic.
