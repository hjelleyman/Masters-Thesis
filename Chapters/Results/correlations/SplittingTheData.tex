\section{Splitting the data}
Throughout literature surrounding the behaviour of Antarctic SIE, there is a large focus on the overall increase in SIE up to 2014, \cite{Parkinson2019} for instance spends some time discussing this, as does \cite{Yuan2017}. They also go into some detail of the spatial variability. More focus is also put on the large decrease in the SIE from 2014 where we get the record largest amount of SIE to 2016 when we get the record lowest SIE. \cite{Meehl2018}
