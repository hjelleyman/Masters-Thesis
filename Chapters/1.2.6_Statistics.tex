\section{Statistical Methods}
This section of the literature review will cover a number of the statistical methods used in different papers which we looked at using for this project. 
\medskip

One such technique we may want to use is change-point analysis as discussed by Beaulieu, Chen, and Sarminento \cite{Beaulieu2012}.
This is used for looking at changes in temporal regimes for time series, they propose it for the purposes of detecting abrupt climate variations. We will also use it for this purpose. The paper provides a good overview of different types of change-points which exist  \textcolor{red}{Include figure?} and a good overview of different ways in which people go about detecting them. They set out to describe and extend an informational approach to this problem, making use of the Schwartz information criterion to identify change points for a variety of fitting models.
